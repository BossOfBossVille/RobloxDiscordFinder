# Roblox Discord Finder

### What is this?
A tool to find Discords corresponding to Roblox accounts with added friend searching for maximum efficiency.

### How do I run it?
- First download rdf.py
- Make sure you have Python installed and PATH variables enabled
- Open cmd.exe and cd into the files parent directory

Run: ```pip install requests``` (you only need to run this line once) then ```py rdf.py username_here```

If you would like to save your log run this instead: ```py rdf.py username_here > users.log```

### What does this tool use?
This tool uses 2 methods to find Discords:
- Searching through users descriptions with Regex
- Checking the [RoPro](https://ropro.io/) API for a linked Discord

### What is the intended use for this tool?
To make finding peoples Discords from Roblox easier. Roblox Discord Finder searches through a users friends list (aswell as the target user) to find their Discords too so even if you can't find who you are looking for, their friends may be able to help you out.
